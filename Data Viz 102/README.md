Materials from the 06/23/2021 Data Visualization 102 Lunch and Learn.

Note: the [COVID-19 Vaccination Rate CSV](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/ipdn-uaih) and [Census Bureau shape file](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020/COUNTY/) are too large to host on GitHub, so you will not be able to run that code in the Binder. Please download the notebook (and those two files) and run the notebook locally.
