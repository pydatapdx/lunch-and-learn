Materials from the 06/23/2021 Data Visualization 102 Lunch and Learn.

Note: the [Census Bureau shape files](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020/COUNTY/) is too large to host on GitHub, so you will not be able to run the associated geopandas code in the Binder. Please download the notebook (and the shape files) and run the notebook locally in Jupyter Lab.
